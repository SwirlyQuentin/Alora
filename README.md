- Used blue/purple to resemble nighttime.
- Home Panel: Displays month buttons for the user to navigate to a specific month entry.
- Month Panel: Display the month at the header with buttons at the bottom to add, edit, view, and delete. In the center, there are shortened entries with a title to quickly access their chosen dream entry.
